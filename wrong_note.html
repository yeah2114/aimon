                <h2>Question 32 - 42 are based on the following passages.</h2>
                <p>This passage is from Stephen Crane’s The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War,
                    first published in 1894. A young soldier has recently enlisted in the Union army, and there have
                    been
                    rumors that they are about to join battle with the Confederate army.</p>
                <div class="passage_area">
                    <p><strong>Passage 1</strong>
                        When presented with the 1 plans, and budget, for the Erie Canal; President Thomas Jefferson
                        dismissed the entire project as “a little short of madness.” However, the visionary farmer Jesse
                        Hawley presented the plans to New York Governor DeWitt Clinton. The governor realized the
                        potential
                        of a canal that would easily link his city to the vast grain-producing region of the Midwestern
                        states and agreed to devote $7 million to building it. Surveying began in 1808, and the Erie
                        Canal
                        was opened for operation in 1825.

                        Building “Clinton’s Folly,” as the canal was derisively dubbed by political detractors, 2 they
                        required innovative new techniques and tools. The original length was 363 miles, from Albany on
                        the
                        Hudson River to Buffalo on Lake Erie. The canal needed 50 locks to 3 assist the 600-foot rise
                        along
                        its course, which was paved with stone set in clay. Huge aqueducts up to 950 feet long were
                        built to
                        divert water during construction.

                        Animals labored, pulling slip 4 scrapers— the equivalent of modern bulldozers, and hauled
                        materials
                        for the workers. The Herculean task app eared impossible at times, particularly because many of
                        the
                        designers and engineers were amateurs who devised new methods to solve each problem as it arose.

                        However, the Erie Canal was constructed in record 5 time and is now considered one of the
                        greatest
                        feats of civil engineering in North America.

                        The efforts of building the canal rapidly paid off, 6 instead, and immediately and irrevocably
                        changed the country’s economy. In the early 1800s, there were no railroads and no navigable
                        rivers
                        between the Great Lakes and Atlantic Ocean, so all freight required portage. There were only
                        five
                        reliable cart roads crossing the Appalachian Mountains. Travel was onerous, slow, and expensive.
                        7
                        It took two and a half weeks to get from New York to Cleveland, Ohio, and four weeks to reach
                        Detroit. The Erie Canal reduced travel time by half and shipping costs by up to 95 percent.
                        Suddenly
                        it became much more feasible to ship high-volume, 8 low-priced commodities such as grain along
                        that
                        route. New York became a major trade center, and 20 it’s economies took off. DeWitt Clinton’s
                        decision to fund the project certainly paid off.

                        The Erie Canal was enlarged several times and became popular not only for shipping freight but
                        also
                        for travel and 10 pleasurable outings for fun with family and friends. The canal’s heyday was in
                        the
                        mid-1800s, and its peak year was 1855 with 33,000 commercial shipments. Today, the canal is a
                        national landmark and primarily used for recreational watercraft, but a few companies 11 still
                        used
                        the historic waterway for the transport of goods. After almost 200 years, the Erie Canal still
                        plays
                        a vital role in the American landscape.
